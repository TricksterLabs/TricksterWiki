## About

We are a team of talented individuals from various backgrounds with the sole purpose of building the most influential decentralized autonomous organization in web3. We pursue financial freedom and self-development through our various tools, services and community hub. Our home is on Cardano but our scope is global.

## Requirements

Holding a **Trickster PFP** grants you **Level 0** access within our community. By playing the loyalty game you are able to increase your ranks and earn **$TRK** tokens.

## Tools and Services

We have and will continue to release tools and services to benefit whole crypto and our community. Premium ones will require spending **$TRICK** tokens.

## Governance

Proposals can be made by anyone with a minimum rank of **Level 1**. Members can then vote using their power score and the result will be carried out by our team until a better system can be implemented.

## Community

The residence of our DAO. By owning the full stack of bots we can take what a discord server can be to the next level. All our services will be linked to the discord in one way or another.

## End Game

Once our work is done and the reliance on centralized services is not needed anymore we envision a self-sustainable group with no central authority or single failure point.
