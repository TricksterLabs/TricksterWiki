## Discord

Our current DAO will be held on discord.

We envision a place of information and collaboration with the purpose of financial freedom and self-development by utilizing all features and custom bots to unlock the full potential of what a community can truly be.

## Bots

There have been various attacks on public discord bots recently. We intend to own the full stack of bots, these include but are not limited to:

- Human Verification Bot
- Holder Verification Bot (with franken exploit fixed and loyalty roles)
- Tipping Bot (from the claimable **$TRICK** amount)
- Data Fetching Bots (utilizing our data analytics API)
- Member Data Validation Bot (utilizing data to it's full potential requires humans to validate their importance and truthfulness)
- Proposal Submission Bot
- Proposal Voting Bot (in which the full **Power** of the voter is taken into account)
- Many more

## Sections

Final structure will be decided within the DAO. We will have the following and their required subsections:

- Crypto Analytics
- NFT Analytics
- Financial Analytics
- World News
- Self-Development
- Proposals
- Missions
- Chill Zones
