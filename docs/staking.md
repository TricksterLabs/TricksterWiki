## Staking Pools

TricksterLabs will be operating a total of 3x Cardano Staking Pools with a 5% commision on ADA rewards.

- [TricksterEU](https://pool.pm/647ac278fff219dced884eef0fac8d863964e5deb1a3c14600354a57)
- TricksterUS (Coming Soon)
- TricksterSEA (Coming Soon)

## Unlocked Staking

To stake and earn **$TRK** tokens you need the following:
- Hold one or more **Trickster PFP** in any Cardano Wallet.
- Stake to your delegated pool.
- (Optional) Hold a minimum amount of ADA based on your **Power** score to maximize benefits

Unlocked staking rewards will be claimable on our website and the distribution will be centralized but verifiable until the total amount of tokens is minted after which only the tokens consumed on our services will be distributed equally based on your total stake compared to others.

## Locked Staking

Until enough fountain sinks are implemented, the mechanism in which we reduce the circulating supply is by offering locked staking rewards at a 10% APR. There will be time-locked pools available to join and operated using smart contracts. The locked staking will be a temporary solution until all the tokens are minted.
