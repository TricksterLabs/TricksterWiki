## Nash Equilibrium

Nash equilibrium states that nothing is gained if any of the players change their strategy if all other players maintain their strategy. Dominant strategy asserts that a player will choose a strategy that will lead to the best outcome regardless of the strategies that other plays have chosen.

## $TRK Token

There will be a total of **1.000.000.000 $TRICK Tokens** as a final circulating supply which measures the distribution time at around **3 years**.

## Tools and Services

Our premium tools and services can be accessed with **$TRICK**. We will have a 5% tax and the remaining 95% will be distributed to the unlocked staking beneficiaries as per their total **Power**.

## Market Dynamics

Since market dynamics are ever changing, so will our service costs. The DAO decides the costs every EPOCH ensuring the best possible outcome.
