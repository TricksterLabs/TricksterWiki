## About

The collection has been under development for over a year. Featuring over 650 hand-made high-resolution traits spread across 10 different categories. These traits could generate over 3000 trillion unique combinations in a vacuum, ensuring each one will feel unique to ensure they pass the test of time. The metadata will contain a **Rarity** trait which determines the final rarity, staking rewards & voting power within our ecosystem. The generation is pseudo-random using our own open-source software to classify different traits together to ensure there are no weird combinations and each one looks incredible while also ensuring that specific combinations get a power boost (i.e.: very low amount of traits will get such bonus). The golden ratio can be found consistently within the artwork.
